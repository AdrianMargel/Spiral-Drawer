# Spiral Drawer
Draws interesting spirally patterns

This program basically uses a stack of points recursively orbiting each other to draw spiral-like patterns. It's a lot like a fancy code spirograph. The program itself is quite short, most of the complexity takes place inside the generate method within the Drawer class where a set of rules determines how each child will generate and thus how the spiral will grow.

I began writting this program as an example to introduce my little sister to sine and cosine. It kind of spiralled out of control and I ended up using it to show her classes and recursion.
